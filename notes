Changes:
- ligating_loop_env.py line 308
    self is wrong: elif self.observation_type == ObservationType.RGBD:
- /imitation/util/util.py
    safe_to_tensor: inconsistent -> if input Tensor, but need to be on another device
    -> won't change tensor
    another workaround would be pushing transitions to gpu, but api doesn't have this function
